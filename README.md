# Prediction_Of_HousePrice_Using_RealEstateData
Prediction of price of house and understanding which real estate factors affect the most in predicting the sales

### Problem Statement:
Consider that a real estate company has the data of real-estate prices in Delhi. The company wants to optimise the selling price of the properties, based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

 

Essentially, the company wants:
- To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g., area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
- To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables, such as the number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well do these variables predict the house prices

### Files
- 'Housing.csv' file contains all the realestate data 
- 'Price_Prediction.ipynb' file contains the code used for data analysis
